You have been granted a table you can use with Cheat Engine 6.6 (included in the .zip) that will transform you into an Ogre.
When transformed you are allowed to perform special Ogre Magic and have access to powerful tools.
These spells will remain active untill you close your game.

When the spells are enabled they are replaced by existing spells (shown by the script description).
This means you will not be able to use the original spells when activated.

Furthermore this table contains many cool scripts like crazy weapon and helm buffs that are not found in the normal game.
Combinations of specific buffs are also available.

Lastly, I have added some tools like "The eye of the Ogre" to spectate other players that will greatly benefit you.

If you like this table, please share it with your friends!

Once the character is transformed into an Ogre in the creator the chances on getting a ban will be minimal.
My general tip is to pick a spot, activate the dried fingers, then unlock the invader limit and have some fun.

--USE THIS TABLE AT YOUR OWN RISK, YOU MAY OR MAY NOT GET BANNED--

--IF YOU GET BANNED, DELETE YOUR CHARACTERS AND WAIT 2-5 WEEKS FOR AN UNBAN--


Your Ogrelord
